  "plan_overview": "This learning plan introduces you to key concepts in database systems focusing on privacy, security, and practical system design considerations. Starting with foundational private information retrieval techniques, you will then explore multi-party operations and user experience challenges in machine learning systems related to databases. The plan concludes with critical thinking about data advocacy and ethical data use. This progression ensures you build technical understanding alongside awareness of real-world implications and user interactions.",
