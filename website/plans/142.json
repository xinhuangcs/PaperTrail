  "plan_overview": "This learning plan focuses on understanding CPU performance and its comparison with GPUs in various computational contexts. Starting with evaluating CPU and GPU performance portability using SYCL, you will then explore detailed CPU vs GPU performance in a CFD-DEM solver, and finally examine CPU and GPU differences in reinforcement learning environments. This progression builds foundational knowledge of CPU architectures and performance characteristics, followed by applied comparisons and optimizations in real-world applications.",
