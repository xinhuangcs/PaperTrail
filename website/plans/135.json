  "plan_overview": "This learning plan guides you through foundational and advanced topics in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) by exploring human behavior modeling, human-machine cooperation, and AI integration in interactive systems. Starting with human behavioral models and variability in interaction, you will progress to multimodal human-robot handover data and social navigation challenges. The plan then covers human-AI bidirectional learning, human-centered AI alignment, and representation learning optimized for human decision-making. Finally, it addresses human-object interaction detection and synthesis of human action-reaction to deepen your understanding of dynamic human interactions in HCI contexts.",
