  "plan_overview": "This learning plan guides you through foundational and advanced topics in first-order logic (FOL) by exploring syntactic fragments, modal extensions, complexity classifications, and applications in team semantics and dependence logic. The strategy is to start with general complexity and expressiveness results, then move to modal and team logic extensions, and finally to specialized fragments and axiomatizations. This progression builds your understanding from classical FOL to modern research frontiers, enabling you to grasp examples and applications effectively.",
