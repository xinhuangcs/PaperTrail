  "plan_overview": "This learning plan guides you through foundational and advanced DSP concepts by exploring active noise control, advanced signal processing techniques in optical communications, and data-driven modeling for industrial systems. Starting with the principles and applications of active noise control provides a practical DSP context. Then, you will deepen your understanding with subband processing and deep learning methods for digital backpropagation. Finally, you will explore the creation of digital twins using DSP for industrial brownfield plants, linking DSP with system modeling and automation.",
