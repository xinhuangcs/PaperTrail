  "plan_overview": "This learning plan introduces you to the fundamentals of 3D rendering by starting with foundational concepts of 3D object representation and reconstruction from 2D images, progressing through modern neural and diffusion-based methods for 3D generation and understanding. The strategy is to build your knowledge from classical 3D modeling and reconstruction techniques, then advance to state-of-the-art deep learning and diffusion models that bridge 2D and 3D data for rendering and generation. Practical understanding is emphasized through actionable steps and measurable outcomes.",
