  "plan_overview": "This learning plan is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of ISO 27001, focusing on understanding the standard's requirements, implementation challenges, and assessment methods. The plan begins with foundational concepts of information security management systems (ISMS) and ISO 27001 compliance, then explores practical assessment frameworks and user acceptance factors. It also covers governance integration with COBIT and extends to related standards and emerging regulatory contexts. The strategy emphasizes actionable knowledge and practical assessment tools to build a solid base for ISO 27001 basics.",
