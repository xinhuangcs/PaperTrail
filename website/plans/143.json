  "plan_overview": "This learning plan guides you through key contemporary topics in software engineering by leveraging three research papers. You will start by understanding the integration of agile and systems engineering in large-scale projects, then explore human factors influencing software engineering risk-taking, and finally analyze challenges in continuous software engineering adoption. This progression builds foundational knowledge, followed by behavioral insights, and culminates in practical challenges and solutions for modern software development.",
