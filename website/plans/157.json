  "plan_overview": "This learning plan guides you through understanding CI/CD pipelines by first grounding you in the concept of data and machine learning pipelines, their optimization, evaluation, and automation. It then expands to collaborative and trusted pipeline management, stakeholder feedback integration, and pipeline performance diagnostics. Finally, it touches on domain-specific pipeline applications to provide a broad perspective. The strategy is to build foundational knowledge before exploring advanced topics and practical tools relevant to CI/CD pipelines.",
